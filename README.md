## Introduction

The Green Machine Learning PhD project aims to explore the environmental impact of various machine learning models. This is achieved by evaluating the performance of different models on three carefully chosen datasets. The key metrics considered are accuracy, model size, and training time.

## Datasets

### Dataset 1: [Pumpkin Seeds Dataset]

## Models

The following models have been selected for evaluation:

1. Deep Neural Network
2. LogisticRegression
3. SVC
4. RandomForestClassifier
5. GradientBoostingClassifier
